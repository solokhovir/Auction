# Sample Hardhat Project

Auction smart contract. The seller can auction some asset for a set price in native tokens (ETH/TRON/MATIC/etc.), withdraw the asset from the auction, accept an offer at a price. The buyer can buy the asset for a set price, or make his own bid.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
